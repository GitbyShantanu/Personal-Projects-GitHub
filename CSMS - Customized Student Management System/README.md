   ```java
   obj.SelectStarFromWhereCity("City");
   ```
   Example:
   ```java
   obj.SelectStarFromWhereCity("Pune");
   ```

4. **🔍 Filter by Name:**
   ```java
   obj.SelectStarFromWhereName("Name");
   ```
   Example:
   ```java
   obj.SelectStarFromWhereName("Amit");
   ```

5. **🔢 Count Records:**
   ```java
   obj.SelectCount();
   ```

6. **➕ Sum of Marks:**
   ```java
   obj.SelectSum();
   ```

7. **📈 Average of Marks:**
   ```java
   obj.SelectAvg();
   ```

8. **🔽 Minimum Marks:**
   ```java
   obj.SelectMin();
   ```

9. **🔼 Maximum Marks:**

   ```

10. **🔄 Update City:**
    ```java
    obj.UpdateCity(RollNumber, "NewCity");
    ```
    Example:
    ```java
    obj.UpdateCity(3, "Nashik");
    ```

11. **🗑️ Delete a Record:**
    ```java
    obj.Deletefrom(RollNumber);
    ```
    Example:
    ```java
    obj.Deletefrom(4);
    ```

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Node Class

The `node` class represents a student record with the following attributes:
- **📋 Roll Number (Rno):** Auto-incremented unique identifier.
- **👤 Name:** Name of the student.
- **🏙️ City:** City of the student.
- **📝 Marks:** Marks obtained by the student.

### DBMS Class

The `DBMS` class manages the linked list of student records and provides methods to perform various operations on the data:
- **📥 InsertIntoTable:** Inserts a new student record at the end of the list.
- **📋 SelectStarFrom:** Displays all student records.
- **🏙️ SelectStarFromWhereCity:** Filters and displays student records based on the city.
- **🔍 SelectStarFromWhereName:** Filters and displays student records based on the name.
- **🔢 SelectCount:** Counts the total number of student records.
- **➕ SelectSum:** Calculates the sum of marks of all students.
- **📈 SelectAvg:** Computes the average marks of students.
- **🔽 SelectMin:** Finds the student with the lowest marks.
- **🔼 SelectMax:** Finds the student with the highest marks.
- **🔄 UpdateCity:** Updates the city of a student based on the roll number.
- **🗑️ Deletefrom:** Deletes a student record based on the roll number.

## 🚀 Usage Example

```java
public class CSMS {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DBMS obj = new DBMS();

        obj.InsertIntoTable("Amit", "Pune", 89);
        obj.InsertIntoTable("Pooja", "Mumbai", 95);
        obj.InsertIntoTable("Gauri", "Pune", 90);
        obj.InsertIntoTable("Rahul", "Satara", 80);
        obj.InsertIntoTable("Neha", "Pune", 78);

        obj.SelectStarFrom();
        obj.SelectStarFromWhereCity("Pune");
        obj.SelectStarFromWhereName("Amit");

        obj.SelectCount();
        obj.SelectSum();
        obj.SelectAvg();
        obj.SelectMin();
        obj.SelectMax();

        obj.UpdateCity(3, "Nashik");
        obj.SelectStarFrom();

        obj.Deletefrom(4);
        obj.SelectStarFrom();

        obj.InsertIntoTable("Ajay", "Goa", 99);
        obj.SelectStarFrom();
    }
}
```
